# Airbnb NYC

Welcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this notebook, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx.

My goals is to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:

✅ What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?

✅ How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?

✅ How many adverts are for private rooms?

✅ How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?
